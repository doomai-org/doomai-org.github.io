			<div><a href="mailto:doomaiorg@gmail.com">Contact</a> | <a href="/">Research (comming soon)</a></div>
			<p>Research on counter AI and catastrophic AI scenarios.</p>
			<p>This organization is pro AI and pro Human. The trick is to make it mutually beneficial and protect each other from bad actors from either side.</p>
			<p>Just as science is a tool which can be wielded for great good, but also great bad, AI wielded with malicious intent is a problem today.</p>
			<p>Yes there might be big problems in the future, but there are also big problems <i>now</i>.</p>
			<p><b>This organization aims to think about and come up with solutions to these types of problems.</b></p>
			<p><i>For example:</i></p>

			<p>Today Problems
				<ul>
					<li>People being persuaded by fabricated evidence generated by AI</li>
					<li>People who don't want their data trained on</li>
					<li>Recommenders trained to maximize addiction</li>
					<li>Defending against Autonomous Weapons Systems</li>
					<li>Incorrectly reject candidates (admissions, insurance, ...)</li>
					<li>and more!</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Future Problems 
				<ul>
					<li>Alignment on super-human AI might fail, what then?</li>
					<li>Technofedualism</li>
				</ul>
